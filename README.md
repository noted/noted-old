# Noted.

Noted is an academic research assistant and social network.

## Proposal

My goal is to create Noted, a web-based tool to aid students and instructors with researching and collaborating on projects. This innovation project hopes to help students with what is now considered tedious, time-consuming work with existing products like NoodleTools. I will be creating the entire website, including programming, design, branding, marketing, and launching it as an actual startup. The goal is to make it self-sufficient, financial-wise—there are very few expenses (web hosting, domains, etc), but with paid plans for using the services, I hope to make it pay for itself and have a little left over for future development.

Like many Internet startups, this idea arose out of frustration. Existing products are, by and large, not well-received by the school population. It is very difficult to use, and for an instructor to teach it to a student for the first time, it takes several class periods. I hope to remove this problem, among others—poor usability, terrible design, and difficult data entry. Collaboration is also a pain with existing products. So rather than keep all projects by default private, everything will be public (with built-in plagiarism detection, of course) and collaboration will be as easy as asking the author for access.

I have been making websites for a while, since making basic, one-page websites in sixth-grade to professional, large-scale websites at an internship last summer. I have as much experience as many web developers in the field right now. I essentially have the actual building of the website covered—it’s the marketing and business aspects that will represent a learning stretch for me. The website is simple, but making it profitable is another story. Hopefully I can take experience from this course and apply it to life after college.

I need to begin by planning out what will be figuring out what exactly a student wants in a research management tool. So, I will be surveying potential customers (students and administrators) to see what they want, and then plan out those features for the site. Then I’ll need to begin branding—logos, marketing materials, etc. Then I’ll begin development work and actually making the site. After, I’ll design the site and apply it to the code I made. At this point, this site will be fully functional and I’ll hopefully have some classes at Farmington High test the site on some projects and compare it to existing products. After working out the final kinks, I’ll release it with to the public.
  

## Roadmap

**June** &mdash; Public launch.


## Technology

I will be writing this entirely in Ruby (with either [Rails](http://rubyonrails.org) or [Padrino](http://padrinorb.com)). I intend to use [MongoDB](http://mongodb.org) for a database, [Compass](http://compass-style.com) for a SCSS framework, and [CoffeeScript](http://coffeescript.org) for compiling to JavaScript. See the [`Gemfile`](https://github.com/eturk/noted/blob/master/Gemfile) for more information.

# Noted.

Noted is an academic research assistant and social network.

If you're from FHS, [here's the "Digication e-Portfolio"](https://fps.digication.com/turkeltaub-capstone). Anyone else (or anyone from FHS that is rational) can just read everything here.

## Proposal

My goal for capstone is to create Noted, a web-based tool to aid students and instructors with researching and collaborating on projects. This innovation project aims to help students with note-taking and source-citing process, which is now considered tedious, time-consuming work with existing products in the market such as NoodleTools. I will be creating the entire website, including programming, design, branding, and marketing. In the end, I plan to have built a self-sufficient web project. It will pay for itself, and perhaps even fund further projects.

Like many Internet startups, this idea arose out of frustration. Existing products are, by and large, not well-received by the school population. It is very difficult to use: for an instructor to teach it to a student for the first time, it takes several class periods. I hope to remove this major problem, while also dealing with poor usability, terrible design, and difficult data entry, etc. Collaboration and sharing is also difficult with existing products—so rather than keep all projects by default private, everything will be public (with built-in plagiarism detection, of course) and collaboration will be as easy as asking the author for access.

I have been making creating for several years, since making basic, one-page websites in sixth-grade to professional, large-scale websites at an internship last summer. I have a similar amount of experience compared to web professionals in the field right. The only technical aspect I will struggle with is handling a lot of people visiting the site at once—I’ve never really worked on a high-traffic site before. Making the website so it can handle thousands of visitors at once will be a new experience for me. Overall, technical aspects and building of the website is not very difficult for me—it’s the marketing and business aspects that will represent a learning stretch for me. The website is simple for me to build, but making it profitable is another story. The service will have a payment plan that is competitive with other products on the market, but to initially fund the project, I am considering “crowdfunding” the project through Kickstarter, a website where people can see and contribute to your project in return for services after the project is created. Hopefully I can take experience from this course and apply it to life after college. This project is ambitious in its’ scale, but achievable in that I have previous experience in the web industry.

I need to begin by planning out who my customers are and what exactly they need in a research tool. So, I will be surveying potential customers (students and administrators) to see what they want, and then plan out those features for the site. Then I’ll need to begin branding—logos, marketing materials, etc. Then I’ll begin development work and actually making the site. After, I’ll design the site and apply it to the code I made. At this point, this site will be fully functional and I’ll hopefully have some classes at Farmington High test the site on some projects and compare it to existing products. After working out the final kinks, I’ll release it with to the public. Afterwards, I will be providing customer support for users of the product and release new features as students begin to use and give feedback.
  

## Roadmap

**September** &mdash; Initial planning and research. Interview potential customers (students, teachers, librarians, etc). Begin preliminary programming.

**October** &mdash; Continue customer research. Start branding and logo design. Finish wireframing all of the site. Explore financial options.

**November** &ndash; **January** &mdash; Program entire site. Finalize web design and branding.

**February** &mdash; Apply design to programmed elements.

**March** &mdash; Begin beta testing—give access codes out online and to classrooms in Farmington Public Schools.

**April** &ndash; **May** &mdash; Listen to user feedback and make appropriate adjustments.

**June** &mdash; Public launch and presentation.


## Technology

I will be writing this entirely in Ruby (with either [Rails](http://rubyonrails.org) or [Padrino](http://padrinorb.com)). I intend to use [MongoDB](http://mongodb.org) for a database, [Compass](http://compass-style.com) for a SCSS framework, and [CoffeeScript](http://coffeescript.org) for compiling to JavaScript. See the [`Gemfile`](https://github.com/eturk/noted/blob/master/Gemfile) for more information.

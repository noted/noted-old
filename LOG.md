## Monthly Log

### September 2012

Though the thought processes for this project started months ago, I only began to flesh out specific details this month. My goal for the past four weeks was to see what exactly students, teachers, and librarians required from such a tool. Looking at what we currently use and weighing the pros and cons is especially helpful.

Some of the features I thought would be useful turned out not to be such. For example, I thought it would be helpful to have handwriting recognition&mdash;if you weren’t too comfortable with taking notes on a keyboard, you can handwrite them, scan them into the computer and upload it to the site. After some interviewing with people, I’ve come to the conclusion that this is far more trouble than it’s worth, both for me and the user.

I’ve gotten great feedback on the project, and people seem to be actually excited about the prospect of a better tool. This genuine interest shows me that I might have a user base for this product.

I am right on schedule for my self-imposed due-by dates. I’ve begun the basic programming for the website, and I’ve thought about what kind of branding and user experience design I’d put into the site. I’ve also made wireframes to plan what exactly it will take a user to do a specific action (for example, what steps it would take to sign up for the site, or make a source, etc). About two weeks into October, I plan to begin seriously programming all of the actions of the site. It will hopefully be barely functional soon.


### October 2012

This month I seriously began work on the code. I was able to overcome the first technological hurdle: figuring out how to model citations data. I found that using Ruby's Hash class would be easy enough -- it allows for flexibility, while still keeping around the features that MongoMapper provides.
 
I also began design work. I posted a screenshot of what I have for the home page so far, and I've recieved good feedback. I think I'll continue designing before I get to the actual programming. This is beneficial because I don't need to write the same code twice.
 
I interviewed Josh from Fanzter, and he brought up many points I hadn't thought of. For example, keeping user data separate and secure, how to sell this product business-to-business, liability, marketing it as a SaaS ("Software-as-a-Service"), insurance, demonstration value, marketing, billing, and support. I also talked to Mrs. Carlson and she gave me more insight as to what librarians need from this product.
 
I've realized that most of the faculty I've talked to want a more structured system (teachers have more privileges than students, teachers have the ability to organized notecards, etc.), while students want an unstructured, do-it-yourself like system. I believe that it would be better to have everyone on the same level, teachers included. I also would like students to have the flexibility to organize how they'd like to&mdash;often times the way a teacher organizes is not right for me.
 
I need to speed up the pace I'm iterating on this project. If I want to have a working version by March, I need to be working faster&mdash;there are many hurdles ahead. Hopefully after this month (and college applications) are over I'll have more time.
